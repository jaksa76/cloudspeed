# Smallface #

The Smallface application is a very simplified version of social networking web sites. There are users that have an email and a password. Two users can be friends. Friendship is bidirectional. Every user can add any other user as a friend, no acceptance is needed. Moreover users add posts. A post is just a string with a date.

When a user logs in, he is presented with all the posts from his friends including his own posts, all ordered by date.
