=How to set up the JBoss cluster on EC2=

Here we will describe a simple configuration with 1 apache instance acting as a load balancer, multiple JBoss instances and one MySQL instance

==Start the database==

  # create the jbossdb database
  # modify the binding-address in /etc/mysql/my.cnf 
  # start MySql server
  # grant permissions to root to connect from EC2


==Start the Jboss intances==
Start a number of ami-4ea34727 images

For each instance:

  # modify the JGroups configuration PING element to include initial_hosts
  # modify the AJP binding address
  # put the mysql connector in lib
  # put mysqlds.xml in deploy (you have to specify the mysql server address here)
  # deploy smallface.ear
  # start jboss in the all configuration


==Start the Apache load balancer==

  # start one ami-4ea34727 image and log into it
  # modify workers.properties to include a worker for each jboss instance
